# About Me



I graduated with my BSc Physics degree from the University of Exeter in 2017. Since then I have gained valuable experience 
working in retail, security and small businesses. I currently work on the stock team for Lush Cosmetics, but I am looking to move into the data sector.
I am passionate about learning, data and science in general. I am well versed in spreadsheets, both Microsoft and Google based, as well as basic programming concepts. I am familiar with Python and I am currently documenting, on this site, my progress in learning the skills required to become a Data Scientist.
