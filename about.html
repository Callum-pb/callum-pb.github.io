								<p>My name is Callum Pillinger-Brown and I love learning. I graduated from the University of Exeter in 2017, with my BSc Physics degree. Since then I have taken some years away from science and education to gain some work and life skills. I have worked in security, retail and stock management, and I've also managed a small business.</p>
								<p>I have become a bit of a generalist, but now I would like to start drilling down again. My goal is to transition into the Data Sector, with aspirations of becoming a data scientist. I have a good grasp of basic programming skills, as well as extensive knowledge of spreadsheets and basic data analysis. I am currently working on revamping my Python skills and expanding my portfolio. A selection of these projects can be found on this site.</p>
								<p>In my spare time, my passions include optimising my life, often using automation skills and honing my setup. I also enjoy cooking and fitness, although it may not look like it. I like to keep up to date with the latest science news, in particular anything involving Physics. You can often find me passionately trying to educate my friends on the latest theories involving the makeup of the universe. </p>
								<p>A copy of my resume can be found <a href="resume.pdf">here</a>, any other queries, please feel free to email me.</p>
