## Info
This blog is a record of my journey into the data sector. 
Currently, I work in retail and stock management for Lush Cosmetics UK.
I am based in Bromley, London, England.
My programming knowledge is limited to some short courses during my undergraduate BSc Physics programme. I have also dabbled in small projects over the years, including extensive MS Excel and Google Sheets projects (such as a tailored finance tracking system linked to my phone). 

On this blog I will record my projects, as I choose them and stuggle through them and make them work, as well as showing the mistakes I make along the way. I hope in years to come, when I am an established and experienced programmer or data scientist, I can look back and see the progress I have made.


## Where I'm at:
I've programmed a bit in C, along time ago. I've relatively comprehensive knowledge of Excel (although I've had a Chromebook for a long time now and therefore haven't used MS in a long time), and currenlty very good knoweldge of Google Sheets. I used these to record a lot of data from my personal life, including my daily weight, and all my finances.
Recently, Ive completed coureses on Courera.org including [Data Science Math Skills](https://www.coursera.org/learn/datasciencemathskills/home/welcome), [Introduction to Programming in MATLAB](https://www.coursera.org/learn/matlab/home/welcome) and [Probability and Statistics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-statistics/home/welcome). I've also completed a couple of the micro-courses on Kaggle.

Right now I'm focussing on getting back to Python. Given my current setup, a not-very-powerful Chromebook in a one room flat with no desk, I'm using Google Colab. I experimented with using linux on the Chromebook. I used it breifly to right an app using python and kivy to use on my phone. This was a simple input app that appended the data directly to some Google Sheets files. However, the dev environment was not for me, everything ran too slow for my current ability, and I ended up finding a more reliable work around. 

So, back to Google Colab.
Right now I have two main Python starter projects. One is explporing my expenses log and the other my weight tracker. 
These projects have allowed me to learn the basics of Pandas and matplotlib libraries. I've also carried out some basic data cleaning and plotting.



## My next steps:
I'd like to do some more comprehensive work with my finances as the data is pretty comprehensive and useful. I have every expense for all of my personal and joint accounts for the last 14 months, as well as some basic income data. I also have my regular expenses and dates for bills in there, which I could use to build projects of account balances etc. 

I'd also like to explore some basic GIS projects. I've come across geopandas as a module I'd like to practice - I'm just trying to think of a project I'd enjoy. I'm torn between following someone elses beginers guide, or doing something I think is currently important, such as mapping data to do with the BLM movement, or crime statisitics to help my arguments.
