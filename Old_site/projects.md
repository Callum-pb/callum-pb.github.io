## Exploring My Finances *(on going)*
Using Google Colab with Python, Pandas and matplotlib to import, clean, explore and visualise my personal finances.
This was a good next step in working with pandas as the size of the data was much larger than the previous project.

This will be an ongoing project, as of course, my finances will continue to change.

The source workbook contains every transaction from all of my accounts for the last 14 months. It also contains gross and net income information for every payslip in that time. It also makes an attempy at handling my joint account with my wife, treating her transfers into the account as income. The workbook also contains information on my regular bills, including dates - this makes me wonder if I could create a model for the future of my bank balances. There's also some qualitive information such as credit cards and credit score, and notes on certain income and expense records.

## Lush Products vs Ingredients *(in progress)*
I wanted to attempt collecting external data, and to also practice some web-scraping. I thought I would start with a subject I already know a lot about, which would help me catch any contextual errors and hopefully speed up the learning curve. 

I have extensive knowledge of the products sold by Lush UK, as I have worked for the company for 3 years. For a long time I wanted to visualise the web that connects the extensive range of products and the many ingredients used. This project has the potential to grow into a geopandas practice projects as well (mapping each contries contribution to each product based on the ingredients sourced there).

For now, I started small. Scraping the products from one section of the website into a dataframe. Next I need to scrape each products ingredients. Then I need to expand to every product on the site.
